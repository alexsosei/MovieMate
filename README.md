# Movie Mate 
# Overview
A personalised platform to stay updated on current and upcoming movies and stay ahead of the curve! 
Bright up your inspiration with random movie quotes. 


As a user, I can search for any movie, series or actor and be directed straight to IMDb for all the information. 
Also, when searching for a movie I want to be able to see all the movies relevant to that search and be able to view the trailer.
